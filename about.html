        <h1>About Ali</h1>
        <p>
            My name is <b>Ali</b>, and I am a Political Science major who believes that students should have
            a clear path into politics. Growing up, I saw how confusing elections, laws, and government could be,
            especially for young people and first-time voters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started Ali's Political Pathways to make politics less intimidating and more accessible.
            My goal is to help students understand how decisions are made, how to participate, and how to become
            leaders in their communities.
        </p>

                <td>Sophomore Year</td>
                <td>Organized voter registration drives on campus and helped new students learn about voting.</td>

                <td>Junior Year</td>

        <h2>What I Believe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Every student should understand how their government works.</li>
            <li>Politics is not just for politicians — it's for everyone.</li>
            <li>Small actions, like voting and volunteering, can create big change.</li>
